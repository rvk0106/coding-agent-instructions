- Environment variables and secrets
- Production build configurations
- Third-party integrations

## React-specific guardrails
- Components stay focused (single responsibility)
- Use hooks properly (dependencies, cleanup)
- State management (Context, Redux, Zustand)
- Accessibility (ARIA, semantic HTML)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Performance (memoization, lazy loading)
